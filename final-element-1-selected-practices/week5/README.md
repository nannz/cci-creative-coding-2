# Week5 Using Numpy to compute images

For week 5, I followed the course exercises and created my own image effect(blur). I did the exercises using pycharm.

In the folder, there are:

- 8 python files: 1-6 are the class exercises. I made some changes and wrote notes. 7-8 are the homework. I explored two kinds of blur effect with different methods.
- 8 png images: They are the example images corresponding to the python exercises.
- `assets` folder with images: They are the images I used for the blur exercises.
