# Week 3 Python Challenge

In this exercise, I completed the first seven python challenges, finishing with my own challenge.

In the folder there are five files:

- `W3-python-challenge.ipynb`: this is the one containing all the challenge solutions and notes. Please open this.
- `Challenge-2.txt`: this is the text I copied from the challenge 2 website. I opened and read it in the python notebook. So you don’t need to take a look on it.
- `Challenge-3.txt`: this is the text I copied from the challenge 3 website. I opened and read it in the python notebook. So you don’t need to take a look on it.
- `Challenge channel.zip` This is the zip file I downloaded for the challenge 5
- `nan.png` : this is the image I created for my own challenge. It’s also documented in the python notebook.
