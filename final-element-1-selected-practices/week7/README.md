# Week 7 - Using TensorFlow to create outputs

There are two parts for this week. 

- `hw` folder: The first one is based on the homework assignment: following CADL tutorial. In this exercise, I learned tf graph and explored different set ups for the neural networks. The corresponding output GIFs are saved in the folder for reference.
- `hw-2` folder: The second one is two exercises based on tensorflow tutorials, in which I created my own style transfer outputs in two ways.
